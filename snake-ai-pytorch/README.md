# Machine Learning Final Project #
## Created by Meghan, Rachel, Will, Edgar ## 
The basic snake game, DQN model, graphing utilities, and agent were written by Python educator Patrick Loeber's, and taken from his github: https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch. 

We added data collection and graphing, training lengths, and model testing to simple_snake. Alongside these additions, we added stationary and moving obstacles to complex_snake_obstacles.
